''' How to use:

## Hardware setup

Note: The computer must have a dedicated ethernet port, and its address must be configured as follows (in `/etc/network/interfaces`):

auto <ethX>
iface <ethX> inet static
address 169.254.98.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

where <ethX> is the name of the ethernet interface. Running `$ ifconfig <ethX>` must return (if it doesn't, restart the computer after changing `/etc/network/interfaces`)

... inet addr:169.254.98.1 ...

(The mainboard does not have a full TCP/IP stack with ARP, so the address must match)

## Running this script

Again, due to the lack of a full TCP/IP stack on the mainboard, this script must be bound to <ethX>, and that operation is only allowed for root.

* Run `$ sudo -s`
* Run `# python udp_comms.py <ethX>`

If will print received data to terminal, and if ROS is found, also publish to ROS at a decimated rate
